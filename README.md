# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## linux.sh
linux.sh checks if you are running linux, then creates .TRASH in your home directory, renames .vimrc to bup.vimrc, and appends .vimrc with new customizations.
## cleanup.sh
cleanup.sh deletes .TRASH, .vimrc, and a a run command from .bashrc.
## .vimrc changes
Turns on syntax, numbering, autoindent, and ruler. Also sets color scheme to elflord.
## .bashrc_custom
Sets up aliases for several commands and alters the tar -zcvf command into a function with a directory.
